These enchanting works of art grace the landscape outside Sidra Medical in the bustling city of Doha, Qatar, offering a visual odyssey through the stages of human development in the womb, culminating in a striking 46-foot sculpture of a newborn baby boy.",
                        "Inspired by the profound mysteries of birth and the complex process of life's creation, Hirst's sculptures are a testament to the beauty and complexity of existence. Ranging from 5 to 11 metres tall and weighing a total of 216 tonnes, each sculpture is a mesmerising ode to the wonder of life.",
                        "Unveiled in 2013 to a sense of anticipation and surprise, the sculptures were gradually revealed, each hidden beneath a balloon that gradually revealed its form. This monumental art installation, valued at $20 million, is a testament to the visionary collaboration between Hirst and the eminent Qatari Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Thanks to her inspired vision, the sculptures found a home in front of Sidra Medical Center, where they continue to captivate visitors with their profound beauty and narrative."
